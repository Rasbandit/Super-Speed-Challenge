"We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Don't fight it, use what happens. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Don't fight it, use what happens. It's important to me that you're happy. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.";
